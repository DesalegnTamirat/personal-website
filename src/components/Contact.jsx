            <h3>Hi, Iâ€™m Desalegn Tamirat</h3>
            <p>
              I am a passionate full-stack developer from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
              with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Addis
              Ababa University.
            
              My journey in technology began during my early years at university,
              and I am committed to building innovative web solutions that connect
              people and enhance user experiences.
            
              When I am not coding, you can find me volunteering to teach
              programming or helping others learn data structures and algorithms.
